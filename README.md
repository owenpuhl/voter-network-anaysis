## Overview

This project investigates **education trends among members of the U.S. Congress** and their connections to **sociopolitical networks**, with a focus on **demographic representation** and **partisan dynamics**.

Through the analysis of congressional education data, we explore how factors such as **gender**, **race/ethnicity**, **party affiliation**, **geography**, and **gerrymandering** intersect with the makeup of representative bodies. The findings aim to inform ongoing discussions on **equity**, **political accountability**, and the structure of American democracy.
